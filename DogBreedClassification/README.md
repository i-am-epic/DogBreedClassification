# DOG BREED CLASSIFICATION
Use a Pre-trained Image Classifier to Identify Dog Breeds


Determine which image classification algorithm works the "best" on classifying images as "dogs" or "not dogs".

Determine how well the "best" classification algorithm works on correctly identifying a dog's breed. 

If you are confused by the term image classifier look at it simply as a tool that has an input and an output. The Input is an image. The output determines what the image depicts. (for example, a dog). 

Be mindful of the fact that image classifiers do not always categorize the images correctly.

Time how long each algorithm takes to solve the classification problem. With computational tasks, there is often a trade-off between accuracy and runtime.

The more accurate an algorithm, the higher the likelihood that it will take more time to run and use more computational resources to run.

## Requirements

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the required libraries.

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision
```

## Usage
Run check_images.py.
```
python check_images.py --dir upload_images

```
